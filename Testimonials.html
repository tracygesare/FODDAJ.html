	<h2>Testimonial 1: Jane Mwikali, Leadership Program Participant</h2>
	
	<p>
	 "Before joining FODDAJ’s leadership training, I never thought I could make a 
	 difference in my community. The training gave me the skills and 
	 confidence to run for office in my local council. Today, I’m proud to serve as 
	 an elected representative, advocating for women’s rights and development in my
	 area. FODDAJ has truly empowered me to be a voice for change!"
	</p>

	<h2>Testimonial 2: Aisha Mohammed, Economic Empowerment Program</h2>
	<p>
	"As a single mother, I struggled to provide for my family. FODDAJ’s economic 
	empowerment program taught me financial literacy and business skills. With their 
	support, I started my own small business. Now, not only can I support my 
	children, but I’m also mentoring other women in my community. FODDAJ gave me 
	the tools to transform my life."

	<h2>Testimonial 3: Christine Wanjiru, Gender Justice Advocacy</h2>
	<p>
	"FODDAJ’s advocacy for gender justice saved my life. After experiencing domestic 
	violence, I felt alone and helpless. Through their legal support and counseling 
	services, I was able to secure justice and rebuild my life. I’m forever grateful
	for their dedication to women’s rights and their unwavering support in my darkest
	time."

<article>
	<h2>Testimonial 4: Faith Otieno, Community Outreach</h2>
	<p>
	"FODDAJ has opened my eyes to the importance of community activism. As a young 
	woman, I wasn’t aware of my rights or how I could contribute to social justice.
	Through FODDAJ’s outreach programs, I’ve become an advocate for gender equality
	in my village, and now I’m encouraging other women to speak up and take action.
	FODDAJ has truly been a life-changing experience."

	<h2>Testimonial 5: Grace Njeri, Women’s Health Awareness</h2>
	<p>
	"Thanks to FODDAJ’s women’s health program, I gained access to critical information
	about reproductive health that was previously unavailable in my community. The 
	workshops and counseling sessions have empowered me to take control of my health
	and make informed decisions. I’m incredibly grateful for FODDAJ’s dedication to
	women’s well-being."
